# smartex_frontend_challenge

This challenge provides a simple look at getting started with Angular to call into a RESTful service. Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started.

## Run the Application Locally

> Keep in mind that Node/NPM and Angular CLI are required to run the application

* Go into the /app folder
* Run `npm i` to install project dependencies
* Run `ng serve` to compile and start the application
* Browse to http://localhost:4200 (4200 should be the default port)

### Run Unit Tests

* Go into the /app folder
* Run `ng test` to open the test environment in the browser
